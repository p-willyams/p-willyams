## Projects  
- [**End-To-End-Rossman-Sales-Prediction:**](https://github.com/p-willyams/end-to-end-rossmansales-prediction.git)

  This project aimed to develop a predictive model to estimate store sales for the next six weeks across a pharmacy retail chain. By leveraging historical sales data, store attributes, promotions, and temporal features, the model provides actionable insights to guide strategic decisions, such as     investments, renovations, and marketing campaigns.
  The workflow included data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, and validation using advanced Machine Learning techniques. The outcome supports optimized resource allocation and improved planning, enabling the company to anticipate sales trends and make more         informed business decisions.
